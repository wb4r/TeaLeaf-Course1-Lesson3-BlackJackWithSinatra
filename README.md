# TeaLeaf-Course1-Lesson3-BlackJackWithSinatra

TeaLeaf Academy - Course 1: Introduction to Ruby and Web Development - September 2015

Assignment: convert our previous BlackJack game to a Web hosted game using Sinatra locally. The previous version didn't work as expected and this assignment was started from zero.


I've tried to accomplish the objectives without looking at the solutions, and I succeded in almost everything after watching the first video on how to interact with the basic commands. 

There is an option implemented, consequence of not viewing the videos before coding, that is unused. I thougth it had to be implemented aswell and in this version has no use at all: the betting option. 

Thanks and enjoy
