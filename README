I've tried to accomplish the objectives without looking at the solutions, and I succeded in almost everything after watching the first video on how to interact with the basic commands. 

There is an option implemented, consequence of not viewing the videos before coding, that is unused. I thougth it had to be implemented aswell and in this version has no use at all: the betting option. 

Thanks and enjoy
